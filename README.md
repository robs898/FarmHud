## Notes

White circle indicates the range where the blizzard yellow blips/nodes will show.

You may have to mouse over the middle to get the pfquest nodes to show.

You can't mouse over the yellow blips/nodes because it disables mouse interaction. This is a trade off because if we enabled mouse interaction you wouldnt be able to click through and you would just ping the minimap.
